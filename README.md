# TennisJS

## What is it?

A vanilla Javascript library for scoring tennis matches, keeping track of each point and how it was won, as well as various statistics.  It provides functions
enabling the front-end to use either LocalStorage API or a back-end system for persistence.

## Where can I find it?

## Where to send bugs?

https://github.com/mattriffle/tennisjs/issues

## What else is included?

At present there's an equally vanilla example interface provided in the `vanilla_example` subdirectory.

A more elaborate interface is planned but not yet built.  Maybe even a backend that lets other people spectate on scoring in progress.  (Imagined use case: letting family keep track of a child's game when only one person can attend.) 

## What are the limitations?

Probably lots of things?  One issue is that while you can certainly use it to score doubles matches, it won't keep track of each server separately.
